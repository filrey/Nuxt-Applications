          call!! ( 818 )- 647- 5638 Add exterior painting to your summer to-do
          list! Many homeowners wonder when the best time of the year is to
          schedule exterior painting projects. While exterior painting can be
          done at nearly any time during the year (under the right conditions),
          the warmer months are usually the best time to take care of outdoor
          projects – include exterior painting in summer! While California
          doesn’t see much rain or snow in the fall and winter, pushing off your
          home’s exterior paint job is not a good idea. Battling the elements
          has never been our much-loved weekend plan, so be sure to check off
          exterior painting before the summer’s end. Here are five reasons to
          schedule your exterior painting this summer: Recover quickly from
          winter damage – The harsh winter weather can take a toll on your
          home’s exterior. Water can enter materials and cause rapid damage and
          wood rot, causing your home to look less than ideal and to be in a
          fragile state. Protecting your home from the elements is a smart move
          to make in the summer! Exterior painting is best done before other
          outdoor projects – If you have landscaping or gardening work around
          the house, why not get the painting done first? This way we don’t have
          to work around new plants or keep the paint out of the fresh mulch!
          The temperatures are right – Mild temperatures allow house painters to
          work quickly and efficiently, all while ensuring that the paint film
          has a good formation before it gets too hot. The sunshine highlights
          your home – Washing away the winter mud, dust, and mildew, and getting
          a fresh paint job is the perfect way to get your home looking
          summer-ready for all of your barbeque backyard parties! Improves the
          curb appeal – Are you putting your home on the market this year? Tick
          curb appeal off your list as soon as you get a new paint job! Your
          home will look great and it’ll be in top condition! Why not get

          the center of the room and cover with plastic or move furniture to the
          area of the house that we are not currently working on. 2. Cover all
          hard flooring with red rosin (thick paper) and carpet with .7 mil
          plastic. (We do not bring drop clothes into your home. Drop clothes
          hold allergens, dirt, and contaminants from other people’s homes.) 3.
          Cover all other surfaces that are not to be painted such as: cabinets,
          countertops, lights, switches, outlets, etc. 4. Spray and back roll
          ceilings (two coats) to provide even and smooth coverage throughout
          the surfaces to be painted. 5. Fill holes with wood filler in any new
          trim or areas needed. 6. Sand all trim, doors, and wood surfaces. 7.
          In 80% of our jobs we apply Zinsser BIN shellac primer to wood
          surfaces whether they have been painted before or not. This is
          typically to convert oil finishes over to water-based finishes. It is
          also used when a previous paint job was done poorly. This is the
          strongest primer available and encapsulates the material below it. 8.
          Repeat the same process on all doors and drawers at our shop, in our
          ventilated spray booth and temperature controlled drying rooms. 9. New
          pre-primed surfaces receive second coat of primer. 10. Sand all of the
          primer once it is dry and spray the finish coat. (Depending on your
          job you may receive a second coat of finish paint.) For the second
          coat we will repeat this step. 11. Cover the new trim with tape and
          paper. 12. Repair nail holes and picture hangers in drywall as well as
          areas of concern that are pointed out during the estimate and noted in
          the contract. 13. Lightly sand all of the walls to remove “trash” from
          previous paint jobs. 14. Spot texture drywall repairs to blend with
          the surrounding area. 15. Prime all new materials: joint compound,
          texture, new drywall oil-based paints. 16. Brush and roll the walls
          with the first coat of paint. After it dries, we will light sand to
          remove any additional trash in the paint. The second and final coat of
          paint is brushed and rolled. Note: whites, yellows, reds and other
          transparent colors may take 3-4 coats). 17. Final step is to clean up,
          move furniture back and enjoy!
